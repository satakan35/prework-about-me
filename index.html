      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Here we go… I met with my wife 2014 in Ankara in Turkey and then we decided to get married so i married with my wife 01.16.2016 in my hometown Aksaray in Turkey, it is about 30 minutes to Cappadocia. I taught Turkish to foreigners in Ankara till 2016. After that, August 2016 we moved to Ningbo/ China. I became a Rotary Club member. I was managing www.ningborotary.com and teaching English to a countryside primary school’s students. BTW we had such an amazing angel baby Evin May 2018 in Ningbo and it was a loooong day for us. Calendars were showing August 2019…we moved to United States of America. I was looking for jobs as a teacher in USA but I decided to change my career. I did not have any chance to do this in my country but I could do it here so it was correct time to start and learn coding, now I have chance to develop websites and creat applications…here i am and i enrolled to CWRU Coding Bootcamp  and I ’m a bootcamp student at Case Western Reserve University Coding Bootcamp in partnership with Trilogy Education services.
